# What is this
This repository is a collection of machine/deep learning project ideas and my own experimental approaches to solving them. These projects are often inspired by random thoughts or challenges I come across, and the solutions are based entirely on my own ideas without heavily relying on online resources.

Please note that these solutions may not always be practical or fully optimized, they are meant to be experiments and learning opportunities for me (and hopefully you).

Most of the datasets used are either created by me or simplified versions designed to test the core ideas in the easiest possible scenarios. However, I did not upload the datasets here as they would be too large to upload, but I provided the code used to generate them.

# Projects
| Project Name                 | Field                             | Description |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [**Count-Objects-Regression**](https://github.com/MajedTB/ML-Projects/tree/main/Count-Objects-Regression) | Computer Vision                   | An experimental approach to count objects in images using a pretrained CNN followed by simple regression layers. No object detection or density maps are involved - the model directly predicts the count. |
| **Arabic-Text-Dottization**  | Natural Language Processing (NLP) | A sequence modeling task aiming to restore diacritic dots to Arabic text. The model learns to predict dotted characters from undotted input using character-level sequential modeling. |
