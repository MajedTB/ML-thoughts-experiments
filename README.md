This repository is a collection of machine learning project ideas and my own experimental approaches to solving them. These projects are often inspired by random thoughts or challenges I come across, and the solutions are based entirely on my own ideas without heavy relying on online resources.

Please note that these solutions may not always be practical or fully optimized, they are meant to be experiments and learning opportunities.

Most of the datasets used are either created by me or simplified versions designed to test the core ideas in the easiest possible scenarios.
